# CPRE 288
This was introductory course in embedded systems. We programmed Roomba sensors to perform specific tasks in each lab. The end goal was to create a final project that could navigate using the sensors on the robot alone.

###### Lab 1
Display a rotating banner on the LCD screen that is 20 characters wide. Useful for displaying data in real time.

###### Lab 2
Start to move the Roomba. Robot should be able to process a hit on its bumpers and be able to "go around" the obstacle.

###### Lab 3
